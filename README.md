This project involves building a webpage that allows users to view the weather wherever. Additionally, the user can switch between the temperature unit and the weather icon, and the background image will adjust to the current weather. Along with HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Body-Parser, it is developed utilising OpenWeatherMap to obtain the weather data via API.
